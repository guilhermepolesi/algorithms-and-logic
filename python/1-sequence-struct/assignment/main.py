# Write a program that directly assigns variables.
# Assign the main types (string, integer, character, floating-point and logical).
# Enter your name, age, gender and height.
# The logical value is determined false if the age is less than 40, and true for greater than 40.
# Print the information.

# The Python language does not require a main method to execute the program
# as long as it contains the correct interpreter.
# The program starts and stops until the end of the script.

# In the Python language, you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before assigning a value to it.
# The Python interpreter automatically infers the variable's type based on the assigned value.
# If necessary or by preference, it is possible to define the type in the declaration.

# String declaration, you need to use " " or ' '
name = "John"

# Declaration of integers
age = 53

# Character declaration, you need to use " " or ''
gender = 'M'

# Floating point declaration
height = 1.76

# Logical value declaration
logical = True

# Function to print on the screen, use the 'f' before the text to indicate the formatting of the function
# to use the braces {} to indicate the correct position of the variables in the text
# The "\n" is used to jump to the line below.
print(f"Name: {name}\nAge: {age}\nGender: {gender}\nHeight: {height}\nLogical value: {logical}")
